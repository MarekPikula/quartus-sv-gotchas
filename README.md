# Intel Quartus SystemVerilog gotchas

In this document I would like to express my discontent with Intel Quartus SystemVerilog support and ways to work around the gotchas I stumbled upon, while porting [PULPissimo](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpissimo/) SoC system to Quartus.

The document is currently work in progress since the porting isn't finished yet, but the author wanted to make a catalog of all the little things he stumbled upon for future reference, while working on the code.
